# Hi! I'm human, for now 👻

I love to create 🤖. 
And programming has become the meaning of life for me ⌨️. 
However, this understanding came to me quite recently 🤷‍♂️.

I program in Python. At the moment I am studying at Yandex Practicum, and created my first prototype of the site in the first months of training:

http://ext.pythonanywhere.com


In the process of work, I superficially mastered the technology:

## HTML ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106249804/194072033-69d7d869-0d26-4c74-8e36-cd3f7c9fd77a.png)

## CSS
## Bootstrap

I learned how to work with Docker, and with something else there.

But that wasn't enough and I created a TODO telegram bot for my family:
https://github.com/exp-ext/family_bot.git

In fact, in programming, I have a lot of plans. But to implement them, you need a team and a lot of money 💵
