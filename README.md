# Hi! I'm human, for now üëª

I love to create ü§ñ. 
And programming has become the meaning of life for me ‚å®Ô∏è. 
However, this understanding came to me quite recently ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I program in Python. At the moment I am studying at Yandex Practicum, and created my first prototype of the site in the first months of training:

http://ext.pythonanywhere.com

In the process of work, I superficially mastered the technology:

[Django](https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2415/PNG/512/django_plain_logo_icon_146558.png),
HTML,
CSS,
Bootstrap.

I learned how to work with Docker, and with something else there.

But that wasn't enough and I created a TODO telegram bot for my family:
https://github.com/exp-ext/family_bot.git

In fact, in programming, I have a lot of plans. But to implement them, you need a team and a lot of money üíµ
